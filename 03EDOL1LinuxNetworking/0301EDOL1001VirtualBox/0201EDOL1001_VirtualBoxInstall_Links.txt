!!! Terminal not opening on Ubuntu 22.04 on Virtual box 7.0.0
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1435918/terminal-not-opening-on-ubuntu-22-04-on-virtual-box-7-0-0
Same on vbox 7.0, I had fixed it adding en_US.UTF-8 instead of en_US to the /etc/default/locale 
then sudo locale-gen --purge and reboot.

My solution was to create a new VM with a new installation. This time I selected "Skip unattended 
installation" when I created the VM, so that the Guest Additions was not automatically installed. 
Now I could start the terminal! After this I installed the Guest Additions using sudo apt-get install 
virtualbox-guest-additions-iso. In this way I got an old version of the Guest Additions, but that 
version seems to work fine.
So obviously the problem is related to the Guest Additions.
